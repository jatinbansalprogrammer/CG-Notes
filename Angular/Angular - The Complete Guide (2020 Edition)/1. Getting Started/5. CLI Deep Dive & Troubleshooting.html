<p>In the next lecture, we're going to&nbsp;build our first little app!</p><p>If the CLI&nbsp;prompts you to<strong> answer some questions </strong>(some versions do that), you can simply hit <code><strong>ENTER</strong></code>&nbsp;for all questions. This will accept the default settings which are fine for this course.</p><p>The CLI&nbsp;generates a different welcome screen than you're going to see in my video though. No worries, you'll still be able to follow along without issues!&nbsp;Just make sure to code along <strong>so that your code equals mine</strong> - Angular itself didn't change a bit :)</p><p>-----</p><p>If you want to <strong>dive deeper into the CLI</strong>&nbsp;and learn more about its usage, have a look at its official <strong>documentation</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki</a></p><p><strong>You encountered issues during the installation of the CLI or setup of a new Angular project?</strong></p><p>A lot of problems are solved by making sure you're using the latest version of NodeJS, npm and the CLI itself.</p><p><strong>Updating NodeJS:</strong></p><p>Go to nodejs.org and download the latest version - uninstall (all) installed versions on your machine first.</p><p><strong>Updating npm:</strong></p><p>Run <code>[sudo] npm install -g npm</code>&nbsp; (<code>sudo</code>&nbsp; is only required on Mac/&nbsp;Linux)</p><p><strong>Updating the CLI</strong></p><p><code>[sudo] npm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular/cli</code>&nbsp;</p><p><code>npm cache verify</code>&nbsp;</p><p><code>[sudo] npm install -g @angular/cli</code>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are some common issues &amp;&nbsp;solutions:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Creation of a new project takes forever (longer than 3 minutes)</strong><br>That happens on Windows from time to time =&gt;&nbsp;Try running the command line as administrator</p></li><li><p><strong>You get an EADDR error (Address already in use)</strong><br>You might already have another ng serve process running - make sure to quit that or use <code>ng serve --port ANOTHERPORT</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;to serve your project on a new port</p></li><li><p><strong>My changes are not reflected in the browser (App is not compiling)</strong><br>Check if the window running <code>ng serve</code>&nbsp; displays an error. If that's not the case, make sure you're using the latest CLI&nbsp;version and try restarting your CLI</p></li></ol>
