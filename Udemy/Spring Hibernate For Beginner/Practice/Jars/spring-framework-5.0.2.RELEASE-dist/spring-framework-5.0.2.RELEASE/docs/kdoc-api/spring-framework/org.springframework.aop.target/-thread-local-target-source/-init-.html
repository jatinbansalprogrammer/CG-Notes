<p>Alternative to an object pool. This org.springframework.aop.TargetSource uses a threading model in which every thread has its own copy of the target. There's no contention for targets. Target object creation is kept to a minimum on the running server. 
<p>Application code is written as to a normal pool; callers can't assume they will be dealing with the same instance in invocations in different threads. However, state can be relied on during the operations of a single thread: for example, if one caller makes repeated calls on the AOP proxy. </p>
<p>Cleanup of thread-bound objects is performed on BeanFactory destruction, calling their <code>DisposableBean.destroy()</code> method if available. Be aware that many thread-bound objects can be around until the application actually shuts down.</p>
