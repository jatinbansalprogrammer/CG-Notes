<p>Implementation of ViewResolver that resolves a view based on the request file name or <code>Accept</code> header. 
<p>The <code>ContentNegotiatingViewResolver</code> does not resolve views itself, but delegates to other ViewResolvers. By default, these other view resolvers are picked up automatically from the application context, though they can also be set explicitly by using the <code><a href="#">viewResolvers</a></code> property. <strong>Note</strong> that in order for this view resolver to work properly, the <code><a href="set-order.html">order</a></code> property needs to be set to a higher precedence than the others (the default is <code><a href="#">Ordered#HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE</a></code>). </p>
<p>This view resolver uses the requested MediaType to select a suitable View for a request. The requested media type is determined through the configured ContentNegotiationManager. Once the requested media type has been determined, this resolver queries each delegate view resolver for a View and determines if the requested media type is <a href="#">compatible</a> with the view's <a href="#">content type</a>). The most compatible view is returned. </p>
<p>Additionally, this view resolver exposes the <code><a href="#">defaultViews</a></code> property, allowing you to override the views provided by the view resolvers. Note that these default views are offered as candidates, and still need have the content type requested (via file extension, parameter, or <code>Accept</code> header, described above). </p>
<p>For example, if the request path is <code>/view.html</code>, this view resolver will look for a view that has the <code>text/html</code> content type (based on the <code>html</code> file extension). A request for <code>/view</code> with a <code>text/html</code> request <code>Accept</code> header has the same result.</p>
