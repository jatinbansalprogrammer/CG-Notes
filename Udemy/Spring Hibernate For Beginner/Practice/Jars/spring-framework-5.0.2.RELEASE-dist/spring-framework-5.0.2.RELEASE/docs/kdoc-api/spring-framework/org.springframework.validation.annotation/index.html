<code><span class="keyword">class </span><span class="identifier">Validated</span></code>
<p>Variant of JSR-303's javax.validation.Valid, supporting the specification of validation groups. Designed for convenient use with Spring's JSR-303 support but not JSR-303 specific. 
<p>Can be used e.g. with Spring MVC handler methods arguments. Supported through org.springframework.validation.SmartValidator's validation hint concept, with validation group classes acting as hint objects. </p>
<p>Can also be used with method level validation, indicating that a specific class is supposed to be validated at the method level (acting as a pointcut for the corresponding validation interceptor), but also optionally specifying the validation groups for method-level validation in the annotated class. Applying this annotation at the method level allows for overriding the validation groups for a specific method but does not serve as a pointcut; a class-level annotation is nevertheless necessary to trigger method validation for a specific bean to begin with. Can also be used as a meta-annotation on a custom stereotype annotation or a custom group-specific validated annotation.</p>
