<p>Important:Â We will regularly start with a clean database server (i.e. all data was purged) in this course.</p><p>To get rid of your data, you can simply load the database you want to get rid of (<code>use databaseName</code>) and then execute <code>db.dropDatabase()</code>.</p><p>Similarly, you could get rid of a single collection in a database via <code>db.myCollection.drop()</code>.</p>
