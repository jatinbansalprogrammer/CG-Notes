Hi, here is Yatan Kumar Good looking man, MCA qualified, a Senior Software Engineer in a reputed MNC company Capgemini in Gurgoan and much much intelligent in my job field.

I'm very soft, a big animal lover, emotional never try to hurt anyone and never interfere into other's life.
I believe and enjoy every moment of life with myself, family and friends.

I have very good inner eye to see the things as they are without manipulating them. 

Looking for a partner as a friend with whom I can enjoy my life happily, share my emotions and who is always besides me. The same I will do for her to make it equal and justified.

My thought is We are alive, happy as long as we are learning new things. so now learning Guitar then would join Dance class. Learning to cook is in my Wishlist.
I'm Soft-Spoken, hoping the same quality in my partner.Very sensitive to my dress and the aura around me. I don't like newspapers, TV news channels which feed our brain with unnecessary garbage.

I'm very crazy about travelling âœˆ and watching movies only in theatre every weekend with butter-topping over a large pop-corn tub 
If the same I find in my partner, then it's a bonus for me.

Within next 20-30years after collecting good amount of money as savings, I want to shift to some hill station City like Shimla, Dehradun or Mussoorie forever where I want to spend the rest of my life peacefully along with my partner and there I will either do "Work from home" in some Software Company or open some IT Institute. The complete decision of moving will be mutual not individual. 

Girl: If she is non-veg, I don't have any issue even though I'm veg.
Girl must be sensitive not only to humans but all living and non-living things bcoz I feel that
