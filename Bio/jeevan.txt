Hi, here is Yatan Kumar Good looking man, MCA qualified, a Senior Software Engineer in a reputed MNC company and much intelligent in my job field.

I'm very soft, big big big animal loverüêï, emotional never try to hurt anyone and never interfere into other's life.
I believe and enjoy every moment of life with myself, family and friends.

Looking for a partner as a friend with whom I can enjoy my life happily, share my emotions and who is always besides me. The same I will do for her to make it equal and justified.

My thought is We are alive, happy as long as we are learning new things. so now learning Guitarüé∏ then would join Dance class.Learning to cook is in my Wishlist.
I'm Soft-Spoken, hoping the same quality in my partner.üòáVery sensitive to my dress and the aura around me.
I don't like newspapers, TV news channels which feed our brain with unnecessary garbage.

Note: I'm very crazy about travelling‚úà and watching movies only in theatre every weekend with butter-topping over a large pop-corn tub 
If the same I find in my partner, then it's a bonus for me.

Within next 20-30years after collecting good amount of money as savings, I want to shift to some hill station Cityüå≥ like Dehradun forever where I want to spend the rest of my life peacefully and there I will either do Work from home in some Software Company or open some IT Institute. 

Girl: If she is non-veg, I don't have any issue even though I'm veg.
Girl must be sensitive not only to humans but also to non-living things as I feel even non-living things have got feelings so I treat them with love.
