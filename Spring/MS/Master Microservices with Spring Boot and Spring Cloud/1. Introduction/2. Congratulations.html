<p><b>Three things</b> you would need to know before starting the course:</p>

<ol><li><p><b><i>Set Yourselves a Goal</i></b> - <i>Spend at least 28 minutes everyday, with this course, for the next week</i>.</p></li><li><p>Udemy asks a review very early in the course and at multiple intervals. If you feel you are not ready to leave a review, feel free to skip the review using the ’Skip’ or ‘I’ll respond later’ or ‘Cancel' buttons at the bottom of your review screen.</p></li><li><p>Subtitles for this course are still primitive - at <i>alpha level</i>. Udemy is providing these as a test. We are working on them and they should improve over a period of time.</p></li></ol>

<p>Have a little bit of patience for the first two hours and you should love it :)</p>
